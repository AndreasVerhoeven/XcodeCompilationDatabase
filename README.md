# Xcode Compilation Database

This program generates a compilation database based on [Xcode's build
graph](http://jerrymarino.com/2017/05/16/reversing-xcodes-build-graph.html).
It simply loads the build graph writes out `compile_commands.json`.

CompilationDatabase is file format for compile commands [Clang's Compilation
Database](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/JSONCompilationDatabase.html).

It currently supports Swift Commands only: 

Program language tooling needs a Compilation Databases as input in order to
setup the compiler stack. The canonical uses of Comp DBâ€™s are LibTooling and
clang-c. I wrote this for
[SwiftySwiftVim](https://github.com/jerrymarino/swiftyswiftvim), to generate
compilation databases for basic Swift Xcode projects. The goal is it easy to
integrate semantic tooling into Xcode projects.

**Note: Tested on Xcode 8.3.1, it uses Xcode's undocumented APIs**


## Usage

First, build and install. Optionally, use the install script:

```
./install.sh
```

It should be able to generate `compile_commands.json`.
```
# Usage: [BuildRootURI] -db_dir /Path/To/Write/compile_commands.json
XCCompilationDB __DERIVED_DATA/MyProj-UID/Build/Intermediates/MyProj.build/Debug/MyTarget.build/
```
This directory is the directory containing a `dpgh` file ( Dependency Graph )

### Create a Compilation Database for each build ( like CMake )

You'll need a `Post Build Action` your build.

First, create a post action, and **pass environment variables** of the target.

Run the CompilationDatabase program for `builds`. 
```
if [[ -z $SWIFT_OPTIMIZATION_LEVEL ]]; then
    exit 0
fi
XCCompilationDB $TARGET_TEMP_DIR -db_dir $SOURCE_ROOT
```

*note: Xcode does not pass the `$ACTION` to this script, so checking the
`$SWIFT_OPTIMIZATION_LEVEL` is a hacky way to differentiate between builds and
cleans.*


## Future Ideas:

- Support clang, so this can be used for YouCompleteMe and LibTooling and more.

## Alternatives

- XCPretty can generate a Comp DB for clang. Eventually, it may for swift too.
